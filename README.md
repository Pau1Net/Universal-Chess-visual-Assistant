# Universal-Chess-visual-Assistant
This repository ll be contain the code for the "Universal Chess Assistant". Start date of development - 08.01.2023

At the expense of the "cheating" aspect. I don't support it, but I am convinced that anyone who wants to do it will do it. There are a lot of ways on the Internet. My reason is purely scientific.These developments will be further applied in other areas.

The main feature of the program will be the visual accompaniment of the game. The program, at the user's command, will search for the board and then, automatically (or at the user's choice), determine the color of the user's pieces and recommend, throughout the game, the best possible moves by drawing an arrow from the figure to the place where this figure should be recommended. The program is supposed to be used on all possible websites, applications, etc. The program is supposed to be completely free and will have an open source code.

At the moment there are only small developments and a very buggy (very) version of the application, which I am not ready to present here. For now, there will be current, completely new developments here, which I literally write right here.

If you yourself have some developments in this matter, I will be glad to any suggestions in the comments. I look forward to the day when all this will be completed
